🔹 9.Founding Story Script (2–3 minutes)

*"Hi, my name is Takyi Romanus, and I’m a computer science student at the University of Energy and Natural Resources. My journey in technology started years ago, back in high school, when I was the Vice President of the Robotics Club at Opoku Ware School, Robotech. I was fascinated by how technology and AI can shape the world, and how robotics can bring ideas to life.

However, my early journey wasn’t without challenges. I came from a humble background, and there wasn’t always space or resources for me to explore my interests fully. I knew there was more to learn, but balancing school, bills, and life meant that my tech know-how was limited at that time.

When I started university and joined the Computer Science program, I realized how vast the field is. There are countless paths, resources, and opportunities, but finding the right direction wasn’t easy. I often felt like I was wasting time trying to figure out the most effective way to learn.

During my first summer break, I sat down and asked myself: what if I could create a platform that guides others, so they don’t face the same challenges I did? That’s when Tech Intro was born. My vision was simple: provide targeted tech education, curated resources, and mentorship so students and young people can maximize their learning and take a direct path toward mastery.

For the past few months, I’ve been developing this initiative, connecting with collaborators online, and laying the groundwork to make Tech Intro a resource hub that empowers students, creators, and innovators."
